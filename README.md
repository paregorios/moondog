# Moondog: manage my own images by my own self

 - Don't mess up the origin image file
 - Don't exclude TIFFs
 - Do handle color responsibly

# Todo:

 - copy original file to desired directory
 - extract exif and other header metadata to file
 - create metadata file with original name file
 - create master TIFF
 - if there is an icc profile
    - convert master to ProPhoto
 - else
    - assign SRGB
    - convert master to ProPhoto
